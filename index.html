                    You will play a block of a card game consisting of 160 trials. <p>\
                    Each trial starts with a fixation cross in the middle of the screen followed by one of four cards such as these: <p>\
                    <center>\
                    <img src='./pics/cards/set0/1.png' width='15%'>\

                    </center> <p>\
                    After the card, a question mark appears. This is when you can choose to pick up the card by pressing space or not do anything. <p>\
                    Beware that your response will only get registered while the question mark is on the screen. <p>\
                    Press next to continue.</div>",
                "<div class='instructions'><p> \
                    The combination of a specific card and your action/inaction will earn you points at the end of each trial. <p>\
                    Two of the cards are 'winning cards' which means, the optimal outcome is winning 10 points and the alternative is not getting anything. The remaining two cards are 'losing cards' for which the optimal outcome is not losing anything (0 points) and the alternative is losing 10 points. <p>\
                    In the beginning, however, you do not know which response is correct for each card. You have to learn from trying out different responses to each card to maximize your earnings in the following trials. <p>\
                    Whether a card is a winning or losing card and the right response does not change throughout the block. <p>\

                    Picking up a card will cost you 1 point ('go cost') to simulate the cost of a real-life action in comparison to inaction. <p>\
                    Do not worry about the go cost too much while playing, though. If picking up a card is the right response, it will be worth it. <p>\

                "<div class='instructions'><p> \
                    The game is made more difficult by probabilistic outcomes.<p>\
                    That means that responding correctly will not guarantee you the optimal outcome. Rather, it will increase the probability of you receiving it. Respectively, the wrong response will decrease the probability of the optimal outcome. <p>\
                    Therefore, there will be trials with confusing outcomes. However, the outcomes are not completely random and you should be able to learn the right action for each card over a few more trials.<p>\
